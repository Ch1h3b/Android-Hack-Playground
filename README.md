# JNIapp Tutorial at erev0s.com
A super simple example of using JNI in an Android app.  
  
This example code is part of the tutorial on how to add C/C++ code to an android application either having the source code or the already compiled files.  
The tutorial can be found here -> https://erev0s.com/blog/add-jnicc-your-existing-android-app/

In the master branch you will find the example on how to include already compiled (.so files) libraries in your app.   
In the `JNI_with_Source` branch located [here](https://github.com/erev0s/JNIapp/tree/JNI_with_Source), you will find the code on how to include C/C++ source code in your app.
